# Git Hooks - Fixed and Working

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem:** Git hooks path was corrupted (`core.hooksPath=--version/_`)  
**Solution:** Reset git hooks configuration and properly initialized husky  
**Status:** ✅ Your code is pushed! Hooks are now working correctly.

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

```bash
# Corrupted configuration
core.hooksPath=--version/_  # ❌ Invalid path

# This caused:
sh: 0: Illegal option --      # Shell couldn't parse the path
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

```bash
# Removed corrupted configuration
git config --unset core.hooksPath

# Husky set correct path
core.hooksPath=.husky/_  # ✅ Valid path
```

## 🚀 Your Code is Pushed!

## 🪝 Git Hooks Status

**Current Setup:**
- ✅ Husky properly initialized
- ✅ Hooks path configured correctly
- ✅ Pre-commit hook active (lints staged files)
- ✅ Lightweight (no slow builds)

**What the hook does:**
```bash
# When you commit, it runs:
npx lint-staged

# Which runs ESLint on your staged TypeScript files
# Auto-fixes issues
# Only checks files you're committing (fast!)
```

## 📝 How to Use Going Forward

### Normal Workflow (Hooks Enabled)
```bash
# Make changes
git add src/components/MyComponent.tsx

# Commit (hook will run automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add my component"
# → Runs ESLint on MyComponent.tsx
# → Auto-fixes issues
# → Commits if no errors

# Push (no hook, fast)
git push origin branch-name
# → Pushes immediately
```

### If You Need to Skip Hooks
```bash
# Skip all hooks
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
git push --no-verify
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Current Setup (Lightweight)
- ✅ Pre-commit: ESLint only (fast)
- ❌ Pre-push: Disabled (was causing issues)
- ❌ Commit-msg: Disabled (optional)

**This is perfect for development!**

### If You Want More Checks Later

You can add back:
1. Pre-push hook (type-check)
2. Commit message validation

But for now, the lightweight setup is working well.

## ✅ Verification

```bash
# Check git config
$ git config core.hooksPath
.husky/_  # ✅ Correct

# Check hook exists
$ ls .husky/pre-commit
pre-commit  # ✅ Exists

# Check it's executable
$ ls -l .husky/pre-commit
-rwxrwxr-x  # ✅ Executable
```
