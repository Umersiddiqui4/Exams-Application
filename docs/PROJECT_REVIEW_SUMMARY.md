## 🔴 TOP 3 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. React Hooks Violations (19 errors) 🚨
**File:** `src/components/application-form.tsx`  
**Fix:** Move all hooks to component top (before any returns)  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Could cause unpredictable bugs

### 2. Bundle Size 5.37 MB 🚨
**Issue:** Slow load times for users  
**Fix:** Code splitting + lazy loading  
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Impact:** 40% smaller bundle = faster app

### 3. No Tests 🚨
**Issue:** No confidence in refactoring  
**Fix:** Add Vitest + write basic tests  
**Time:** 2 hours setup + ongoing  
**Impact:** Can refactor safely
